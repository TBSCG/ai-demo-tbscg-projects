# Project Timeline Visualization Feature

## Overview

A visual Gantt-style timeline has been implemented to display project phases positioned by their actual dates, providing an intuitive temporal view of project roadmaps.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Timeline Calculation Utilities (`frontend/src/utils/timelineCalculations.ts`)

Core utility functions for timeline rendering:

- **Date Calculations**: Parse dates, calculate days between dates
- **Timeline Metrics**: Calculate overall timeline bounds with padding
- **Phase Positioning**: Calculate exact left position and width for each phase bar
- **Overlap Detection**: Assign overlapping phases to separate lanes (stacked vertically)
- **Marker Generation**: Generate monthly date markers for the timeline axis
- **Today Indicator**: Calculate position of current date marker

### 2. Timeline Components (`frontend/src/components/PhaseGanttTimeline/`)

**PhaseBar.tsx**
- Renders individual phase as horizontal colored bar
- Status-based coloring (completed=green, in-progress=orange, planned=gray)
- Interactive hover tooltip with full phase details
- Displays phase order number and name (truncated if too small)

**TimelineAxis.tsx**
- Horizontal date axis with month markers
- Month labels (e.g., "Jan 2025", "Feb 2025")
- Vertical grid lines at month boundaries

**TimelineGrid.tsx**
- Background grid lines for visual alignment
- Extends through timeline body

**TodayMarker.tsx**
- Vertical orange line showing current date
- "Today" label at the top
- Only shown if today falls within timeline range

**index.tsx** (Main Component)
- Orchestrates all timeline sub-components
- Handles responsive width calculation
- Manages lane assignment for overlapping phases
- Shows "Unscheduled Phases" section for phases without dates
- Empty state handling (no phases with dates)

### 3. View Toggle (`frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetailPage.tsx`)

- Added toggle buttons: **Timeline View** ↔ **List View**
- Timeline view is the default
- Smooth switching between views
- Icons for each view mode

## Visual Design

### Timeline Structure

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Jan 2025    │ Feb 2025    │ Mar 2025    │ Apr 2025         │ ← Date axis
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [█ 1. Planning █]                          ▼ Today         │ ← Lane 1
│             [████████ 2. Development ████████]             │ ← Lane 2
│                         [██ 3. Testing ██]                 │ ← Lane 1 (reused)
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Unscheduled Phases (2)
[4. Documentation] [5. Launch]
```

### Color Scheme

- **Completed**: Green background, green border
- **In Progress**: Orange background, orange border (#ff8204 primary color)
- **Planned**: Gray background, gray border
- **No Status**: Light blue background, blue border

### Interactive Features

- **Hover**: Tooltip shows full phase details (name, description, dates, status)
- **Responsive**: Container width adapts to viewport
- **Scrollable**: Horizontal scroll for very long timelines

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. ✅ Phases Without Dates
- Phases with missing `startDate` or `endDate` are filtered out
- Displayed separately in "Unscheduled Phases" section
- Badge format for easy scanning

### 2. ✅ No Phases with Dates
- Shows informative empty state
- Message: "Add start and end dates to your phases to see them visualized on a timeline"
- Lists unscheduled phases if any exist

### 3. ✅ Overlapping Phases
- Automatic lane assignment using smart algorithm
- Phases are stacked vertically in separate lanes
- No visual collision between overlapping phases

### 4. ✅ Very Short Phases
- Minimum width of 2% to ensure visibility
- Minimum 1-day duration for calculation
- Phase name truncates with ellipsis if too narrow

### 5. ✅ Timeline Padding
- 7 days padding before first phase
- 7 days padding after last phase
- Provides visual breathing room

### 6. ✅ Today Marker
- Only shown if today falls within timeline range
- Positioned accurately at current date
- High visibility with primary color

### 7. ✅ Sequential (Non-overlapping) Phases
- Efficiently uses single lane when possible
- Lanes reused after phase ends

### 8. ✅ Single Phase
- Works correctly with just one phase
- Timeline scales appropriately

### 9. ✅ Long Timelines
- Horizontal scrolling for timelines > container width
- Month markers provide orientation

## Testing Scenarios

### To Test Manually

1. **Normal Timeline**
   - View a project with 3-5 phases spanning several months
   - Verify phases are positioned correctly by their dates
   - Check phase bars show correct names and order numbers

2. **Overlapping Phases**
   - Create phases with overlapping date ranges
   - Verify they stack in separate lanes
   - No visual collision

3. **View Toggle**
   - Switch between Timeline and List views
   - Verify both views work correctly
   - Check toggle button states

4. **Hover Interactions**
   - Hover over each phase bar
   - Verify tooltip appears with full details
   - Check tooltip positioning

5. **Today Marker**
   - View a project where today falls within phase dates
   - Verify orange "Today" marker appears at correct position

6. **Missing Dates**
   - Create phases without dates
   - Verify they appear in "Unscheduled Phases" section
   - Timeline shows only phases with dates

7. **Empty State**
   - View project with no phases
   - View project with phases but no dates
   - Verify appropriate messages appear

8. **Responsive Behavior**
   - Resize browser window
   - Verify timeline adapts width correctly
   - Check horizontal scroll on narrow viewports

## Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations

- **ResizeObserver**: Efficiently tracks container width changes
- **Memoized Calculations**: Timeline metrics calculated once per render
- **Smart Lane Algorithm**: O(n × lanes) complexity for overlap detection
- **CSS Positioning**: Uses absolute positioning for smooth rendering

### Accessibility

- Phase bars are `<button>` elements (keyboard accessible)
- `aria-label` provides context for screen readers
- High contrast colors for readability
- Semantic HTML structure

### Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Uses standard web APIs (ResizeObserver, Date)
- No external dependencies for timeline rendering

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

These features were planned but deprioritized for initial release:

- [ ] Drag-and-drop to adjust phase dates
- [ ] Zoom controls (zoom in/out on timeline)
- [ ] Export timeline as image
- [ ] Milestone markers
- [ ] Phase dependencies (arrows connecting phases)
- [ ] Progress bars within phase bars (% complete)
- [ ] Filtering by status
- [ ] Quarterly/weekly axis for extreme date ranges
- [ ] Mobile-optimized timeline view

---

## How to Use

### For End Users

1. Navigate to any project detail page
2. Scroll to "Project Roadmap" section
3. Use toggle buttons to switch between:
   - **Timeline View**: Visual Gantt chart (default)
   - **List View**: Traditional vertical list
4. Hover over phase bars to see full details
5. Add dates to phases in edit mode to see them on timeline

### For Developers

**Import the component:**
```typescript
import PhaseGanttTimeline from '../components/PhaseGanttTimeline';

<PhaseGanttTimeline phases={projectPhases} />
```

**Timeline calculations are exported:**
```typescript
import {
  calculateTimelineMetrics,
  calculatePhasePosition,
  assignPhasesToLanes,
  // ... other utilities
} from '../utils/timelineCalculations';
```

## Screenshots / Visual Examples

When testing, you should see:

1. **Timeline View**: Horizontal bars representing phases across time
2. **Month Markers**: "Jan 2025", "Feb 2025", etc. along the top
3. **Colored Bars**: Green (completed), orange (in-progress), gray (planned)
4. **Today Line**: Orange vertical line if today is in range
5. **Hover Tooltips**: Detailed phase info on hover
6. **Unscheduled Section**: Badges for phases without dates
7. **Toggle Buttons**: Timeline/List selector in top-right

---

## Notes

- Timeline defaults to show **Timeline View** (can be changed in `ProjectDetailPage.tsx`)
- All calculations are done client-side (no backend changes)
- Existing `PhaseTimeline` component is preserved for List View
- Design follows Clean Code and SOLID principles
- Uses Tailwind CSS and CSS Modules (no global CSS or Sass)
